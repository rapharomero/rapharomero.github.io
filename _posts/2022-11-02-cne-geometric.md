Conditional Network Embedding (CNE) is a node embedding method for graphs that has been successfully applied to visualization and prediction.
It allows the user to generate embeddings that respect the network structure, while factoring out prior knowledge known in advance.
Applications of this include visualizing the nodes in a network without representing undesired effect, such as for instance having the high degree nodes concentrated in the center of the embedding space.
Such embeddings can also be used to predict links while controlling the influence of sensitive node attributes on the predictions.
This has great interest in producing fair link prediction on social networks for instance.

In what follows we aim to give a comprehensive view of the underlying mechanism that make CNE good at producing embeddings that factor out prior information.

In what follows we express the Conditional Network Embeddings model as a
statistical model for which the parameter space is the cartesian product
of the space of embedding matrices and regression parameters w.r.t. edge
features $$f_{ij}$$. -->

# Conditional network embedding
Conditional Network Embedding is a graph embedding method. Given an undirected graph $G=(U,E)$ where $U$ is the set of nodes and $E\subset U\times U$ is the set of nodes it yields a mapping from the set of nodes to a $d$-dimensional space:

$$
\begin{aligned}
CNE \colon U &\rightarrow && \mathbb{R}^d  \\\\
           u&\mapsto     {}&& z_u \\
\end{aligned}
$$

More specifically, CNE does this mapping while factoring out prior information about the graph, encoded into a Maximum entropy model.
We will first give a brief overview of how a MaxEnt model for graph looks like, before showing how to factor out such a prior model from the embddings.

# Maximum Entropy graph distributions.
### General form
Given a set of nodes $U$, a MaxEnt graph distribution is a distribution on the set of possible graphs, denoted $\mathcal{G}$, connecting this set of nodes, that has maximum entropy under a certain set of constraints.
The intuition is that before observing any graph in nature, one generally has prior expectations about the properties of this graph. For instance, one might have an idea of the number of links, the number of links *per node* (their degree), or the number of links connecting two communities. 

Indeed, the fact that people from the same communities or sharing the same attributes tend to connect more than people having different communities/attributes is something commonly observed in real-world social networks and often quoted as *homophily*.

In general these prior expectations can be expressed or modelled as *statistics* (or *observables* in statistical physics terminology), which are defined as measurable functions taking as input a graph and yielding a real number.

Supposing that we encode our prior expectations into $K$ statistics $f_1,...,f_K$ where each $f_k$ is a real-valued graph function, one can derive a resulting *prior distribution* on the set of possible graphs.

It can be shown that the maximum entropy distribution can be written, for a certain optimal parameter $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^K$ and each graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$:
$$
P(G) = 
\frac{
  \exp(\lambda^T f(G))
  }{
    \sum_{G \in \mathcal{G}}\exp(\lambda^T f(G))
    }
$$

Where $$f(G)=(f_1(G), ..., f_K(G))$$ is the vector-valued sufficient statistic.

### Factorized form
Let $A = (a_{i,j})$ be the adjacency matrix of a graph $G$. Often, the statistics $f_k$ can be written as a sum of a certain subset $S_{k}$ of the entries of the adjacency matrix, i.e. :

$$f_k(G)= \sum\limits_{(i,j)\in S_k} a_{ij},$$

For instance, the degree of a node is the sum of all the entries presento of the corresponding row of the adjacency matrix, the volume of interaction between two communities is the sum of the entries located in a block of the adjacency matrix. Thus these statistics take the above form.

It can be shown that for these statistics the MaxEnt distribution factorizes over the set of edges. More precisely, in that case we can derive edge-specific statistic vectors, denoted $f_{i,j}(G)$, such that:

$$P(G)=\prod\limits_{i\neq j} P(a_{ij})$$
Where 
$$P(a_{ij})= \frac{1}{1+exp(-\lambda^T f_{i,j}(G))}$$
This expression allows to express the graph distribution as a joint distribution of independent edge-specific Bernoulli variables $a_{ij}$. Moreover, the Bernoulli probabilities for each edge are given by a logit $\lambda^T f_{i,j}(G)$, passed through the sigmoid function $\sigma :x\mapsto \frac{1}{1+exp(-x)}$.

### How to turn prior knowledge statistics into a MaxEnt distribution
In practice, such a distribution can used to extract prior information from an observed graph $\hat{G}$. To do this, one just needs to maximize the above likelihood of the observed graph with respect to the parameter vector $\lambda$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\max\limits_{\lambda\in \mathbb{R}^K} P(\hat{G}) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

It can be noted that this Maximum Likelihood problem can be solved using logistic regression. Indeed, for each each edge, we access a feature vector $f_{i,j}(\hat{G})$ use it to predict the presence of absence or link between nodes $i$ and $j$.


In this paragraph, we have seen how MaxEnt model allow us to encode prior knowledge into a graph distribution $P(G)$ and for a certain type of statistics this translates into a set of independent bernoulli variables with proabilities $P_{ij}(a_{ij})=\sigma(\lambda^Tf_{ij}(G))$.
Now we will see how, once we have derived such a MaxEnt distribution, we can use it to find embeddings conditional on this distribution.


# Factoring out prior information in embeddings

In CNE, we suppose that we have encoded our prior expectations about an observed graph $\hat{G}$ into a MaxEnt distribution. 
Based on that, CNE uses Bayes' rule to define a distribution on the set of graphs, parameterized by embeddings, and conditioned on the MaxEnt distribution:

$$
P(G\vert Z) = 
\prod_{i\neq j} 
\frac{
  \mathcal{N}_{+}(d_{ij} | s(a_{ij})) 
  P_{ij}(a_{i,j})
}{
  \sum\limits_{a \in \{0,1\}}
  \mathcal{N}_{+}(d_{ij} | s(a)) 
  P_{ij}(a)
  }
$$

Where 
- $d_{ij} = \vert\vert z_i-z_j \vert\vert$ is the euclidean distance between embeddings $z_i$ and $z_j$.
- $\mathcal{N}_{+}(d\vert s(a))$ denotes a half normal density with spread parameter s(a).
- $s$ is a spread function such that $s_0=s(0)>s(1)=s_1$
- $P_{ij}(a)$ is the MaxEnt prior Bernoulli distribution

While this expression can look complicated at first, it still takes the form of a product of independent probabilities, one for each entry of the adjacency matrix.
Thus one can transform the expression in order to retrieve the Bernoulli probabilities associated with each $a_{ij}$

Indeed, it can be shown that the likelihood can be rewritten as a product of independent Bernoulli likelihoods:
$$P(G\vert Z) = \prod\limits_{i \neq j} Q_{ij}^{a_{ij}}(1-Q_{ij})^{(1-a_{ij})}$$

Where:
  - $ Q_{ij} = \sigma \left(\alpha + \lambda^Tf_{ij} - \beta.\frac{d_{ij}^2}{2} \right) $
  - $\alpha=\log(\frac{s_1}{s_0})$ is a non-negative constant.
  - $\beta=(\frac{1}{s_1^2} - \frac{1}{s_0^2}) \geq 0$ is a scaling constant.
  - $\sigma$ still denotes the sigmoid function


<details>
  <summary>Proof</summary>
  
In order to retrieve this form, we first recall the form of the Half-Normal distribution:

\begin{aligned}
p_{\mathcal{N}_{+}(.\vert s)}(d) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi s^2}} exp(- \frac{d^2}{2 d^2})
\end{aligned}

Moreover, the MaxEnt prior distribution writes:

\begin{aligned}
P_{ij}(a_{ij})=\frac{exp(\lambda^Tf_{ij}(G))}{1+exp(\lambda^Tf_{ij}(G))}
\end{aligned}

Each term of the CNE likelihood product is a Bernoulli probability. Thus the \[Q_{ij}\] can be retrieved by taking $a_{ij}=1$ and injecting that in the CNE terms.

We get:
  \begin{aligned}
  Q_{ij}
  =& \frac{
    \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi s_1^2}} 
    exp(- \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2 s_1^2} + \lambda^Tf_{ij})
    }{
      \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi s_1^2}} 
      exp(- \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2 s_1^2} + \lambda^Tf_{ij}) 
      + 
      \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi s_0^2}} 
      exp(- \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2 s_0^2})
      } \\
=& \frac{1}{1 + \frac{s_1}{s_0} exp(- \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2}(\frac{1}{s_0^2} - \frac{1}{s_1^2}) - \lambda^Tf_{ij})} \\
=& \sigma(\lambda^Tf_{ij} + log(\frac{s_0}{s_1}) - \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2}(\frac{1}{s_1^2} - \frac{1}{s_0^2})) \\
\end{aligned}

</details>


As we see, the Bernoulli probabilities have the same structure as in MaxEnt. 

A logit value is composed by adding up a constant term, the scaled negative distance and linear terms encoding the prior knowledge.
Then this logit is transformed into a binary probability using the sigmoid function.

Intuitively, the term $\lambda^Tf_{ij}$ encodes a similarity between $i$ and $j$ that needs not be represented by the layout of the embeddings $z_i$ and $z_j$. 
# Example: degree and edge features as prior.
We consider a simple example of CNE, where the MaxEnt statistics used are:
- The degree of each node $i$: $f_i^{(degree)}(G) = \sum\limits_{j\in \cal{N}(i)} a_{ij}$. 

Where $\cal{N}(i)$ is the set of neighbors of $i$. This leads to $n$ statistics at the graph level. For each edge $ij$ the corresponding edge-level statistics vector $f_{ij}$ are given by $[E_i^n \vert\vert E_j^n]$, where for each node $i$, $E_i^n$ is the n-dimensional one-hot encoding of the node $i$ and $\vert\vert$ represents the concatenation operation.
Denoting $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^{2n}$  the vector of coefficients associated to these degree statistics, the corresponding logit value is equal to
$$\alpha^Tf_{ij}=\alpha_i + \alpha_j$$ 

- Some edge-level features $x_{ij}$. We denote $\theta$ the associated coefficient and the logit values coming from it are equal to :
$$\theta^T x_{ij}$$

So by stacking all these features, we get the following prior term:

$$\lambda^Tf_{ij}=\alpha_i + \alpha_j + \theta^T x_{ij}$$

The CNE Bernoulli probabilities are thus equal to:


  $$ Q_{ij} = \sigma \left(\alpha + \alpha_i + \alpha_j + \theta^T x_{ij} - \beta.\frac{d_{ij}^2}{2} \right) $$

# Visual explanation 
In order to geometrically explain how CNE factors out prior knowledge, a possible approach is to imagine the (random) edges as Bernoulli random variables, to make them deterministic variables conditioned on the embeddings.

### Deterministic version of the random graphs above.
The sigmoid function is a smooth version of a non-continuous function, the Heaviside step function, given by $h(x) = \mathbb{1}_{\{x>0\}}$.
This one yields an activation equal to 1 for positive inputs and 0 for negative inputs.

![Heaviside]({{site.url}}/figures/sigmoid_vs_heaviside.png)
*The heaviside function in red, and the sigmoid function in green*

Let's consider a CNE model, where we use as constraints the degrees of each nodes, as well as other features.
The CNE expression looks like: 
$$
Q_{ij} = \sigma \left(2 \gamma +\alpha_i + \alpha_j+  \theta^T x_{ij} - \vert\vert z_i-z_j\vert\vert^2 \right)
$$

In the deterministic CNE expression, the link indicators would then look like:
$$a_{ij} =h\left(2\gamma +\alpha_i + \alpha_j+  \theta^Tx_{ij} - \vert\vert z_i-z_j\vert\vert \right)
$$


This has a natural visual interpretation, as shown in the following image
![CNE-DEG]({{site.url}}/figures/cne_deg1.png)

As can be seen, each embedding $z_i$ is endowed with a disk $D_i$of radius $\alpha_i+\gamma$ such that the minimum distance between $D_i$ and $D_j$ in order for the nodes to connect is $\theta^T x_{ij}$.

If the prior similarity is high, the the disk need not be too close for the connection to form. As a consequence, the embeddings will not encode the prior information.



<!-- 
# Binary graphs


The final form of the posterior likelihood takes the form
$$P(G\vertX) = \prod\limits_{i \neq j} \frac{\mathcal{N}_{+}(d_{ij}\vert\sigma(a_{ij}) P_{ij}(a_{ij})}{\sum\limits_{a\in \{0,1\}} \mathcal{N}_{+}(d_{ij}\vert\sigma(a_{ij}) P_{ij}(a_{ij})}$$
Where $$\sigma(0)=\sigma_0>0$$ and $$\sigma(1) = \sigma_1>0$$ is the spread
function, with fixed spread hyper-parameters $$\sigma_0$$ and $$\sigma_1$$,
$$P_{ij}$$ is the prior distribution and $$\mathcal{N}_+$$ is the half
normal distribution.

## Prior distribution

In the binary case, the prior distribution is
$$P(G) = \prod_{i\neq j} P_{ij}(a_{ij})$$

where
$$P_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(\frac{exp(\lambda^T f_{ij})}{1 + exp(\lambda^T f_{ij})})$$
$$f_{ij}$$ being the constraint vector associated with edge $$a_{ij}$$.

::: example*
**Example 1**. *For undirected graphs and degree constraints:
$$P_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(\frac{exp(\lambda_i + \lambda_j)}{1+exp(\lambda_i + \lambda_j)})$$\*

_For directed graphs and in and out degree constraints:
$$P_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(\frac{exp(\lambda*i^r + \lambda_j^c)}{1 +exp(\lambda_i^r + \lambda_j^c)})$$*
:::

## Posterior distribution

As seen above, the CNE likelihood depends on the parameters
$$X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$$ through the matrix of pairwise distances
$$d_{ij}$$ and $$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^K$$.

The likelihood can be rewritten as

$$P(G;X,\lambda) = \prod\limits_{i \neq j} Q_{ij}(X,\lambda)^{a_{ij}}(1-Q_{ij}(X,\lambda))^{(1-a_{ij})}$$

where $$\begin{aligned}
Q_{ij}(X, \lambda) =& \frac{\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi \sigma_1^2}} exp(- \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2 \sigma_1^2} + \lambda^Tf_{ij})}{\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi \sigma_1^2}} exp(- \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2 \sigma_1^2} + \lambda^Tf_{ij}) + \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi s_0^2}} exp(- \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2 s_0^2})} \\
=& \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\sigma_1}{s_0} exp(- \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2}(\frac{1}{s_0^2} - \frac{1}{\sigma_1^2}) - \lambda^Tf_{ij})} \\
=& sigm(\frac{d_{ij}^2}{2}(\frac{1}{s_0^2} - \frac{1}{\sigma_1^2}) + \lambda^Tf_{ij} + log(\frac{s_0}{\sigma_1})) \\
=& sigm(-K(X_i, X_j) + \lambda^Tf_{ij}) \\\end{aligned}$$

where $$sigm: x \mapsto \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$ is the sigmoid function and
$$K(X_i, X_j) =\frac{d_{ij}^2}{2}(\frac{1}{\sigma_1^2} - \frac{1}{s_0^2}) - log(\frac{s_0}{\sigma_1})$$

is a distance kernel. It is non-decreasing in the distance between the
embeddings.

This leads us to an alternative expression for the CNE model:

$$a_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(Q_{ij})$$

with
$$logit(Q_{ij}) = \theta_{ij} = \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2}(\frac{1}{s_0^2} - \frac{1}{\sigma_1^2}) + \lambda^Tf_{ij} + log(\frac{s_0}{\sigma_1})$$

In this expression, one could replace the term
$$d_{ij}^2 = \vert\vertX_i - X_j\vert\vert^2$$ by any kernel $$l(X_i,X_j)$$, or by the
similarity yielded by deep graph embedding models such as GraphSage.

## Objective function and gradient

In CNE we first optimize find the optimal $$\lambda$$ parameter value
using by fitting a maximum entropy model (i.e. logistic regression) of
the network given the edge attributes.

Let's write the likelihood of the CNE under parameters $$X, \lambda$$ with
edge features $$f$$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    p(A\vertF;X,\lambda) = \prod\limits_{i<j} \frac{exp(a_{ij} \theta_{ij})}{1 + exp(\theta_{ij})}\end{aligned}
$$

So the negative log-likelihood writes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    L(A\vertF;X,\lambda) = \sum\limits_{i<j} log(1 + exp(\theta_{ij})) - a_{ij} \theta_{ij}\end{aligned}
$$

While the parameter $$\lambda$$ stays fixed to the Maxent optimum, we use
the chain rule to compute the gradient of this negative log-likelihood
with respect to the embeddings $$X_i$$ for $$i = 1,...,n$$:

Let's denote $$\delta = (\frac{1}{\sigma_1^2} - \frac{1}{s_0^2})$$.
In the original CNE paper we suppose that $$s_0 > \sigma_1$$ so
$$\delta > 0$$.

We have $$\nabla_{X_{i}} (\vert\vertX_i - X_j\vert\vert^2) = 2(X_i - X_j)$$ for any
$$i \neq j$$. As a consequence :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_{X_{i}} (\theta_{ij})
=& \nabla_{X_{i}} (-\delta . \frac{d_{ij}^2}{2} + \lambda^Tf_{ij} + log(\frac{s_0}{\sigma_1})) \\
=& -\delta (X_i - X_j)\\\end{aligned}
$$

We know that the derivative of $$t \mapsto log(1 + t)$$ on $$\mathbb{R}$$ is
the sigmoid function $$\sigma : t \mapsto: \frac{1}{1 + e^{-t}}$$.

So finally:

$$
\nabla_{X_i}(L(A\vertF; X, \lambda)) = \sum\limits_{j \neq i} \delta.(X_i - X_j) (a_{ij} - \sigma(\theta_{ij}))
\label{gradient}
$$

This expression suggest that CNE can be interpreted as a force-directed
network embedding method. Indeed:

- If $$a_{ij} = 0$$, since $$\delta > 0$$ and
  $$\sigma(\theta_{ij})\in]0,1[$$ $$X_i$$ and $$X_j$$ will be tied by the
  force
  $$\vec{f_{ij}^{(0)}} = \delta \sigma(\theta_{ij})\vert\vertX_i-X_j\vert\vert \vec{u_{i\rightarrow j}}$$,
  where $$\vec{u_{i\rightarrow j}}$$ is a unitary vector oriented from
  $$X_i$$ to $$X_j$$. This correspond to the situation on figure
  [\[fig:repforces\]](#fig:repforces){reference-type="ref"
  reference="fig:repforces"}, where the node $$X_i$$ tries to move away
  from $$X_j$$ in order to minimize its energy.

- If $$a_{ij} = 1$$, $$X_i$$ and $$X_j$$ will be tied by the force
  $$\vec{f_{ij}^{(1)}} = - \delta \sigma(-\theta_{ij})\vert\vertX_i-X_j\vert\vert \vec{u_{i\rightarrow j}}$$,
  where $$\vec{u_{i\rightarrow j}}$$ is a unitary vector oriented from
  $$X_i$$ to $$X_j$$. This correspond to the situation on figure
  [\[fig:attrforces\]](#fig:attrforces){reference-type="ref"
  reference="fig:attrforces"}. Here node $$X_i$$ tries to get closer of
  $$X_j$$ instead, hence the direction of the force.

As a consequence, at each step each node embedding will move according
along a direction which is the sum of all forces that they are submitted
to.

## Gradient subsampling

In expression [\[gradient\]](#gradient){reference-type="ref"
reference="gradient"}, it can be seen that each step can be
computationally intensive since a sum of $$\sim n$$ terms must be
computed.

But one can reduce this complexity by approximating for each node the
resultant of forces by the one coming from a sub sample of the nodes
(i.e. we do neighborhood sampling).

To do this we fix a negative/positive rate (for instance $$r=0.1$$) and we
sample a neighborhood $$S(i)$$ of $$i$$ in which this ratio is observed.

The approximate gradient is then given by :

$$
\nabla_{X_i}(L(A\vertF; X, \lambda)) = \sum\limits_{j \neq i, j\in S(i)} \delta.(X_i - X_j) (a_{ij} - \sigma(\theta_{ij}))
\label{approxgradient}
$$

## Extension to the exponential family

The derivation of the objective function and gradient can be made more
general, especially for the cases where we do not want to predict edge
presence absence, but more general edge attributes
$$a_{ij} \in \mathcal{A}$$ ($$A = \mathbb{N}$$ for counts,
$$A = \mathbb{R_+}$$ for real-valued weights for instance). To do this we
make use of the Generalized Linear Model, which is based on several
assumptions

- We assume that the edge attributes are generated from a distribution
  belonging the exponential family:
  $$p(a_{ij}\vert\eta_{ij}) = h(a_{ij})exp(\eta_{ij} a_{ij} - A(\eta_{ij}))$$
  Here A is the cumulant function, $$\eta_{ij}$$ is the natural
  parameter and $$h$$ is the base measure of the distribution.

- The natural parameter of the model is
  $$\eta_{ij} = - \delta.\vert\vertX_i - X_j\vert\vert^2 + \lambda^T f_{ij} + \gamma$$
  where $$\gamma$$ and $$\delta$$ are strictly positive real numbers.

Under these assumptions, the negative log-likelihood of the model can be
written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    L(a\vertf, X, \lambda) =& \sum\limits_{i<j} A(\eta_{ij}) - a_{ij} \eta_{ij} - log(h(a_{ij}))\\\end{aligned}
$$

Suppose that we fix the value of $$\lambda$$ and try to minimize this cost
function with respect to the embeddings $$X_i$$.

First we compute the gradient of the natural parameter with respect to
these embeddings:

$$\nabla_{X_i} (\eta_{ij}) = -\delta . (X_i - X_j)$$

Then using the properties of the cumulant we know that the gradient of
$$A$$ is equal to the expectation of the distribution. Using the chain
rule we get :

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \nabla_{X_i} (A(\eta_{ij}))
    =& (\nabla_{X_i}(\eta_{ij})) \nabla A(\eta_{ij})\\
    =& -\delta. (X_i - X_j) . \mu_{ij}\\\end{aligned}
$$

Where $$\mu_{ij} = \mathbb{E}_{a_{ij}' \sim p(.\vert\eta_{ij})}[a_{ij}']$$ is
the expectation of the distribution. Finally the gradient of $$L$$ can be
expressed as:

$$\nabla_{X_i} L(A\vertF,X,\lambda) = \sum_{i \neq j} \delta.(X_i - X_j).(a_{ij} - \mu_{ij})$$

So as before, the gradient for each embedding is a resultant of $$n-1$$
forces, one for each other node. For each $$j$$ the component of the force
along the oriented line passing from $$X_i$$ to $$X_j$$ is given by
$$\delta.\vert\vertX_i - X_j\vert\vert.(a_{ij} - \mu_{ij})$$. If $$a_{ij}$$ is greater than
the mean, then the embedding $$X_i$$ will be attracted by the embedding
$$X_j$$. Conversely if the $$a_{ij}$$ is lower, $$X_i$$ will tend to move away
from $$X_j$$.

## Expression using the KL divergence between GLM instances

Here we attempt to express the CNE negative log-likelihood in terms of
Kullback-Leibler divergences between several instances of the same
generalized linear model.

Let's introduce some notations to do this.

Let's consider a binary observed variable $$a \in \{0, 1\}$$, and suppose
we would like to derive a Bernoulli model for it.

We'll denote $$\mathbb{P}_{\theta}(a) = exp(\theta a - A(\theta))$$ for
any natural parameter value $$\theta$$. Here
$$A(\theta) = log(1 + exp(\theta))$$ is the cumulant function.

In CNE the natural parameter can be expressed as the sum of two terms,
say $$\beta_{ij}$$ for the pairwise similarity between embeddings and
$$\gamma_{ij}$$ for edge features.

Similarly let's consider that we would like to model our observation
using a natural parameter of the same form:

$$\eta = \beta + \gamma$$

Then the maximum likelihood estimation of $$\mathbb{P}_{\eta}$$ is the
same as minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (i.e. the negative
log-likelihood) from the empirical distribution $$\hat{\mathbb{P}}$$ to
$$\mathbb{P}_{\eta}$$. The latter can be written as:

$$KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\eta}) = KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta + \gamma}) =  A(\beta + \gamma) - a (\beta + \gamma)$$

Similarly we can write the KL divergences between models
$$\mathbb{P}_{\beta}$$ and $$\mathbb{P}_{\gamma}$$ and the empirical
distribution as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta}) =&  A(\beta) - a \beta \\
KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\gamma}) =&  A(\gamma) - a \gamma    \end{aligned}
$$

Let's now consider the divergences between the model distributions. We
have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
KL(\mathbb{P}_{\gamma} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta + \gamma}) =& A(\beta + \gamma) - (A(\gamma) + \beta \sigma(\gamma))\\
KL(\mathbb{P}_{\beta} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\gamma}) =& A(\gamma) - (A(\beta) + (\gamma - \beta) \sigma(\beta))\\
KL(\mathbb{P}_{\gamma} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta}) =& A(\beta) - (A(\gamma) + (\beta - \gamma) \sigma(\gamma))\\\end{aligned}
$$

where $$\sigma$$ is the sigmoid function.

Furthermore, the entropy of the distribution $$\mathbb{P}_{\gamma}$$ can
be written as:

$$H(\mathbb{P}_{\gamma}) = A(\gamma) - \gamma \sigma(\gamma)$$

So combining all of these equations we get:

$$
\label{kldev}
KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta + \gamma}) =
KL(\mathbb{P}_{\gamma} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta + \gamma})
+ KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\gamma})
+ KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert\mathbb{P}_{\beta})
- KL(\mathbb{P}_{\gamma} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta})
- H(\mathbb{P}_{\gamma})
$$

Note that this equation is symmetric in $$\beta$$ and $$\gamma$$, and that
we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
KL(\mathbb{P}_{\gamma} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta + \gamma})
- KL(\mathbb{P}_{\gamma} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta})
- H(\mathbb{P}_{\gamma}) =&
KL(\mathbb{P}_{\beta} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\gamma + \beta})
- KL(\mathbb{P}_{\beta} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\gamma})
- H(\mathbb{P}_{\beta}) \\
=& -I(\beta, \gamma)\end{aligned}
$$

where we define
$$I(\beta, \gamma) = A(\beta) + A(\gamma) - A(\beta + \gamma) > 0$$ This
term quantifies the interactions between the two effects that are taken
into account in the model.

More precisely if we define the random variables $$B$$ and $$C$$ such that

- $$B \sim \mathbb{P}_{\beta}$$

- $$C \sim \mathbb{P}_{\gamma}$$

- $$B \cap C \sim \mathbb{P}_{\beta + \gamma}$$

Then $$I(\beta, \gamma)$$ is the mutual information between $$B$$ and $$C$$.

On Figure [1](#fig:corrterm){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:corrterm"} we plot the opposite of this interaction term
as a 3d surface. We see that it is strictly negative for any value of
parameters, and that the maximal values are obtained on the line

::: proof
_Proof._ Equation [\[kldev\]](#kldev){reference-type="ref"
reference="kldev"} can be proved by replacing the KL divergences by
their development above. For the positivity of $$I$$, we remind the
definition of the cumulant function in the exponential family where
$$p(x\vert\theta) = exp(a \theta - A(\theta))$$ with respect to a base measure
$$h$$. For any $$\theta$$ in the natural parameter space $$\mathcal{N}$$ (the
space where this integral converges).

$$A(\theta) = log(\int exp(a \theta) dh(a))$$

Let's denote $$Z(\theta) = \int exp(a \theta) dh(a)$$ and compute for any
$$\beta, \gamma \in \mathcal{N}$$ such that
$$\beta + \gamma \in \mathcal{N}$$: $$\begin{aligned}
Z(\beta + \gamma) - Z(\beta)Z(\gamma)
=& \int exp(a (\beta + \gamma)) dh(a) - \int exp(s (\beta))dh(s)\int exp(t (\gamma))dh(t) \\
=& \int exp(a (\beta + \gamma)) dh(a) - \int exp(t \beta + s \gamma)dh(s)dh(t) \\
=& \int \mathbbm{1}_{\{s=t\}}exp(s \beta + t\gamma)) dh(s)dh(t) - \int exp(t \beta + s \gamma)dh(s)dh(t) \\
=& \int (\mathbbm{1}_{\{s=t\}} - 1) exp(s \beta + t\gamma)) dh(s)dh(t) < 0\\\end{aligned}$$
The last inequality comes from the positivity of the integral and the
fact that the integrand is strictly negative.

So this gives us $$\frac{Z(\beta) Z(\gamma)}{Z(\beta + \gamma)} > 1$$

Taking the log of this expression gives us that $$I(\beta, \gamma) > 0$$Â â»

Equation [\[kldev\]](#kldev){reference-type="ref" reference="kldev"} can
be written in the following compact form :

$$
\begin{aligned}
    KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta + \gamma}) =  KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\gamma})
+ KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta})
- I(\beta, \gamma)\end{aligned}
$$

Going back to the CNE formalism, here the term
$$KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\gamma})$$ would be the Maxent
objective function, $$KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta})$$ would
be the likelihood of the embedding model fitted without any Covariate
term, and $$I(\beta, \gamma)$$ encodes the interactions between the
covariates and the embeddings.

Because of the $$-$$ sign in front of $$I$$, minimizing this expression with
respect to both $$\gamma$$ and $$\beta$$ would automatically tend to
maximize the interaction term.

Conversely CNE process consists in training
$$KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\gamma})$$ separately without the
interaction term, and then fix the $$\gamma$$ value to find the $$\beta$$
for which this interaction is reduced compared to if we would perform a
full joint training.

Indeed the objective of the CNE with respect to $$\beta$$ is

$$KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta})  - I(\beta, \gamma)$$

It can be seen as a _conditional_ objective: removing this mutual
information term is similar to conditioning in probability terminology.

Let's make this conditional objective more flexible by adding a weight
$$\alpha$$ in front of the mutual information term.

$$KL(\hat{\mathbb{P}} \vert\vert \mathbb{P}_{\beta})  - \alpha I(\beta, \gamma)$$

Then the hyperparameter $$\alpha$$ should control to what extend we want
to remove the information already learned by $$\gamma$$ from the
embeddings $$\beta$$.

# Expression as a Bayesian Network

The various conditional dependencies that are present in the CNE can be
summerized using the means of a bayesian network. In the binary
undirected case, this network would contain:

- $$\frac{n (n-1)}{2}$$ nodes to model the values $$a_{i,j}$$ in the
  adjacency matrix

- $$\frac{n (n-1)}{2}$$ features vector to model the values $$f_{i,j}$$ of
  the edge features

- $$n$$ nodes containing the embeddings $$X_{i}$$.

- $$1$$ node containing the vector $$\lambda$$

Although the full network would be more complex to represent, we can
easily represent the neighborhood of a given each $$a_{ij}$$ nodes:

On Figure [\[fig:cnegm\]](#fig:cnegm){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:cnegm"} the $$X_i$$ and $$X_j$$ are also connected to all the
others $$a_{ij}$$ and $$f_{ij}$$ in the model, but since they are root nodes
(they don't have parents nodes), the local representation is sufficient
to derive the joint probability.

Let's suppose we postulate prior distributions $$p(X)$$ and $$p(\lambda)$$
on the embeddings and on the parameters $$\lambda$$. For instance:
$$X_i \overset{iid}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$$ and
$$\lambda \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Gamma)$$ with
$$\Sigma, \Gamma \in S_n^+(\mathbb{R})\times S_K^+(\mathbb{R})$$
respectively.

The joint probability factorizes with respect to the graphical model
above as :
$$p(A,F, X, \lambda) = \prod\limits_{i<j} p(a_{ij}\vertf_{ij}, x_{i}, x_j, \lambda) p(f_{ij})p(\lambda)p(x_i)p(x_j)p(\lambda)$$

Formally, the posterior distribution on the parameters would then write
as:

$$p(X,\lambda\vertA,F)=\frac{p(A,F\vertX, \lambda) \times  p(X)p(\lambda) }{\int\limits_{X,\lambda} p(A,F\vertX, \lambda) \times  p(X)p(\lambda)} dX d\lambda$$ -->
