  <!-- <h1 class="content-listing-header sans">About</h1>
  <div>Welcome to my personal page! I'm a second year PhD student in computer science and statistics, the <a
    href="https://aida.ugent.be/">AIDA Goup</a> of Ghent University and IDlab.
  
  I work under the supervision of profesor Tijl De Bie on graph embedding and longitudinal network modelling using
  survival analysis.
  
  Previously I worked one year as a Data Scientist at Shift Technology in Paris. Before that I completed a Msc in
  Mathematics, Computer Vision and Machine learning at ENS Paris-Saclay (former ENS Cachan), as well as a MEng at Telecom
  Paris.
  
  On this website I plan to post articles summarizing research ideas, as well as miscellaneous technical content. -->
