I work under the supervision of profesor Tijl De Bie on graph embedding and longitudinal network modelling using survival analysis.

Previously I worked one year as a Data Scientist at [Shift Technology](https://www.shift-technology.com/fr/) in Paris and interned 6 month in the Paris-based start-up [Jalgos AI](https://jalgos.com/).

Before that I completed a Msc in Mathematics, Computer Vision and Machine learning at ENS Paris-Saclay (former ENS Cachan), as well as a MEng at Telecom Paris.
