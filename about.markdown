Welcome to my personal page! I'm a second year PhD student in computer science and statistics, the [AIDA group](https://aida.ugent.be/) of Ghent University and IDlab.

I work under the supervision of profesor Tijl De Bie on graph embedding and longitudinal network modelling using survival analysis.

Previously I worked one year as a Data Scientist at Shift Technology in Paris. Before that I completed a Msc in Mathematics, Computer Vision and Machine learning at ENS Paris-Saclay (former ENS Cachan), as well as a MEng at Telecom Paris.

On this website I plan to post articles summarizing research ideas, as well as miscellaneous technical content.
